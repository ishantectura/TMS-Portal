        <p> Carlsberg revealed its biggest idea yet – a pop-up bar in London made entirely from chocolate! The pop-up, entitled If Carlsberg Did Chocolate Bars, appeared as a giant bar of chocolate affixed to the wall of the Truman Brewery in Shoreditch this morning.</p>

        <p>At 12pm today Carlsberg unwrapped the foil on the front of the bar to unveil a fully functioning, three-metre-deep pop-up bar, which was specially commissioned ahead of the Easter bank holiday weekend.</p>

        <p>The bar, measuring five metres wide by two metres high, contains intricate chocolate features that you’d expect to see in a traditional British pub.</p>

        <p>Highlights included a handcrafted chocolate dartboard, carefully constructed chocolate bar stools and a bespoke chocolate television screen, showcasing one of England’s greatest World Cup moments.</p>
